my programming language, btw


Examples:
```
Welcome to !lang of version: 0.0.1
>>> print 5
>>>
[*] Splitting 1 lines (8 symbols)...
[*] Parsing 2 words...
[$] Joined=['print', '5']
parseprint: 5
addr0
[*] interpreting 2 commands... ([0, 5, 0])
[$] NEW (0)
[$] MOV (i0)(o5)
[$] PTINTL (0)
5
```

At the end of file you must initiate EOF (Control+D) or write ```FILEEND``` at the new line.
