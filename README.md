my programming language, btw


Examples:
```
Welcome to !lang of version: 0.0.1
>>> print 5 print 7
>>> FILEEND
[*] Splitting 1 lines (15 symbols)...
[*] Parsing 4 words...
[$] Joined=['print', '5', 'print', '7']
[*] interpreting 2 commands...
[$] Print (5)
5
[$] Print (7)
7
```

At the end of file you must write ```FILEEND``` at the new line.
